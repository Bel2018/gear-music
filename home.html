      <div class="para">
          <h4 class="head">Welcome to my home page</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">Thanks for checkout my page. The main purpose of creating this page that I am learning, which mean
              I am not any kind of professional. I just like to share while I am also learning for myself. One thing that
              like in life is learning from other people who is willing to share and sharing your experience with other
              people who may need it. For me, everything
              is about sharing with people what you learn, but not keep yourself.</p><br>

            <p class="paragraph">So today, I like to share my knowledge about music studion. Why? Because I like music and I like
                to share what I know. Before, I set up my own home studio, I did a lot of research and later come up with
                my little home studio. What I did was listening, watching, reading alot about how people set up their
                studio and what they need. I have watched and read about people studio literally from professional
                studio to basic bed room studio which were just computer, audio interface, headphone, and microphone.
                So that, I can come up and set up my own studio as I am able to offer to buy things
                and the way I like it to be slowly and slowly. </p><br>
            <p class="paragraph">So, if you are new to set up home studio, these information might be useful for you. You are welcome to click
                around my pages and think to creat on your own.</p>
                <br>
            <p class="paragraph"><strong>Note:</strong> It is not that I have everything that I share in these pages. I just throw out the
         information that I know. But if you are a starter, this would give you at least some ideas.</p>
